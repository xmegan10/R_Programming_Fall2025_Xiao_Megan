## Erroneous myMean Function

From Task 3, I create the vector "assignment2" and the function "myMean."
```{r}
# create numerical vector assignment2
assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

#create function myMean that returns the average of a vector
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
}
```

Attempting to pass assignment2 into myMean results in the following error:

```{r}

```

## Correcting myMean


```{r}
