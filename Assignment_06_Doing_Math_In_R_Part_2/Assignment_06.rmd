## Matrix Addition & Subtraction
Matrix operations allow us to combine matrices using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; this is helpful for transforming large systems to model real-word situations. Physics, engineering, and technology all require matrices and matrix operations.
We will first look at addition and subtraction. Let's create two 2x2 matrices:
```{r}
A <- matrix(c(2, 0, 1, 3), ncol = 2)
B <- matrix(c(5, 2, 4, -1), ncol = 2)
```
