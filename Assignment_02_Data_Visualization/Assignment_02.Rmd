## Define and Inspect Your Data

First, I create the following vectors:


```{r}
Name <- c("Jeb", "Donald", "Ted", "Marco", "Carly", "Hillary", "Bernie")
ABC_poll <- c(4, 62, 51, 21, 2, 14, 15)
CBS_poll <- c( 12, 75, 43, 19, 1, 21, 19)
```

I combine these vectors into a DataFrame.

```{r}
df_polls <- data.frame(Name, ABC_poll, CBS_poll)
```

The resulting DataFrame:

```{r}
df_polls
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
