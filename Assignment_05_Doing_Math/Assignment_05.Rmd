## Create the matrics
A matrix is a 2D array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Mathematicians often use arrays to organize and work with structured information. Matrices are used in a wide variety of applications, such as physics, quantum mechanics, or computer graphic displays. <br>
R allows us to create matrices using the matrix() function. Here, we create two matrices: A and B. A consists of numbers 1 to 100 ascending top-down (column) and left-right (row). B consists of numbers 1 to 1000 ascending in a similar way to A. We specify the argument nrow = 10 to force both matrices to have only 10 rows. However, since ncol was not specified, R will create a new column and continue filling the matrix after the 10th row. <br>
```{r}
A <- matrix(1:100, nrow = 10)
B <- matrix(1:1000, nrow = 10)
```

## Inspect Dimensions
To inspect the number of rows and columns of our matrices, we can use the dim() function. This function returns two numbers; the first number is the number of rows in the matrix. The second is the number of columns. <br>

```{r}
dim(A)
```
<br>Matrix A has 10 rows and 10 columns. It is a square matrix because it has the same number of columns as it has rows. <br>
```{r}
dim(B)
```

## Compute Inverse and Determinant

```{r}
# For A
invA <- solve(A)
detA <- det(A)

# For B, use tryCatch to capture errors
invB <- tryCatch(solve(B), error = function(e) e)
detB <- tryCatch(det(B),   error = function(e) e)
```
